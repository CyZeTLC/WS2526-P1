    "- Goal from code: grab USB -> unlock file collection -> collect folders -> survive hazards -> touch finish.\n",
    "- Modules: **core** (entities, events, packets/serialization), **client** (JavaFX screens, levels, audio, input), **server** (TCP listener, packet routing, DB hooks prepared).\n",
    "- Startup path: `Game.start` loads `config.json`, applies sound (muted/volume), registers listeners, builds `ScreenManager`, creates MainMenu/Settings, selects level via `currentLevel` (Tutorial/Second/Boss).\n",
    "- Game loop: dedicated thread in `ScreenManager` (~200 Hz) computes `delta`+FPS, invokes `currentScreen.update(delta)` via `Platform.runLater`.\n",
    "- Runtime pipeline:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Scene input -> InputManager -> ScreenManager.update(delta) -> GameScreen.update(delta)\n",
    "  -> physics/collision -> camera offset -> HUD update -> render/sound\n",

    "**Step-by-step (GameScreen + Entities/Blocks)**\n",
    "- Capture input: `InputManager` tracks held keys + `pollJustPressed` for toggles.\n",
    "- Player init: `EntityPlayer` (maxHealth=3) reset on screen switch; name tag & sprite placed.\n",
    "- Movement params: gravity=15, moveSpeed=450, jumpPower=800 (Jump/Speed perks +25% for 10s).\n",
    "- Update loop: compute dx/dy, apply gravity, build next bounds.\n",
    "- Collisions: platforms first (landing/sides), then blocks (items/perks/hazards/enemy); `pendingBlocks` for freshly spawned lasers.\n",
    "- Interaction: E triggers `GasBarrierBlock.deactivate()` only if flipper flag set.\n",
    "- Enemies: `RobotEnemyBlock` patrols within [minX,maxX], faces player, fires `LaserBlock` if |dx|<440 (cooldown 1.2s, lifetime 4s, 1 dmg; removed even in GodMode). Stomp from above kills.\n",
    "- Hazards: `LavaBlock` -0.25 HP/tick (ignored in GodMode).\n",
    "- Items/Progress: `USBStickBlock` sets `canCollectFiles=true`; `FolderBlock` counts only then and deactivates; `FlipperItem` sets barrier key flag.\n",
    "- Camera: dead zone marginX=400, marginY=150, smoothing=0.1; sprites offset by camera.\n",
    "- HUD: quest text, files `X/Y` (active folders), flipper hint, health hearts (maxHealth=3), debug bar on F2, tooltips on F1.\n",
    "- Game states: game over on HP<=0 or fall -> MainMenu; pause shows overlay (logic keeps running).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design decisions**\n",
    "- Delta-based physics in own thread, UI updates on JavaFX thread to avoid stutter.\n",
    "- F3 toggles GodMode/NoClip for fast debugging; GodMode blocks damage, NoClip skips collisions.\n",
    "- Fixed laser lifetime (4s) for simple timing.\n",
    "- Folder collection gated by USB for clear progression.\n",
    "- Fixed camera smoothing/dead-zone to keep motion stable.\n",
